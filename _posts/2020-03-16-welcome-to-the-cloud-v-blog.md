Cloud V has always been kind of mysterious to a lot of people, I'd imagine: it's a website where things happen, but the developers and our process is kind of hidden. Wellâ€¦ we want to change that.

Exciting things are happening, and that is why we decided to launch this blog- dedicated to all the cool things we do so it is no longer silent.

Watch this space for more cool updates on what we're doing, what's upcoming, and what's in stock for the future.
